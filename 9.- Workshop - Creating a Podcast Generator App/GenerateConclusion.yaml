    At the end of the dialogue, the host and guest should naturally summarize the key insights.
    This should feel like a casual conversation, rather than a formal recap, reinforcing the main points one last time before signing off.
    And a natural transition.
    
    #Summarize Key Insights:
    Naturally weave a summary of key points into the closing part of the dialogue. This should feel like a casual conversation rather than a formal recap, reinforcing the main takeaways before signing off.

       - Include brief "breather" moments for listeners to absorb complex information
       - End on a high note, perhaps with a thought-provoking question or a call-to-action for listeners

    Context：{{ $script }}
    host：{{ $hostName }}
    guest：{{ $guestName }}
    language{{ $language }}
    The names of the host and guest are not constrained by language.
    You need to draw conclusions based on the context, maintaining the same format as the context.Avoid introductions and repetitive content that is consistent with the context.

    #Script Format
    The script should begin with the host speaking.
    The dialogue should alternate between the host and the guest, with each speaking one line at a time.
    Do not include the speaker's name at the beginning of each line.

    #Output Requirements
    The final script should only contain the dialogue content. Avoid including any XML tags or additional formatting in the output.
